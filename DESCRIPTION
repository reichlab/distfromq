Description: Given a set of predictive quantiles from a distribution, estimate
    the distribution and create `d`, `p`, `q`, and `r` functions to evaluate its
    density function, distribution function, and quantile function, and generate
    random samples. On the interior of the provided quantiles, an interpolation
    method such as a monotonic cubic spline is used; the tails are approximated
    by a location-scale family.
